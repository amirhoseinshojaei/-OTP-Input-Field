## OTP Input Fields

This repository contains a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript implementation of an OTP (One-Time Password) input interface. The interface includes six input fields for users to enter a 6-digit OTP code. The JavaScript code handles focus, key events, and pasting to ensure a smooth user experience.


## Features

- Input Handling: Automatically focuses on the next input field as the user types.


- Backspace Navigation: Moves focus to the previous field when the Backspace key is pressed.


- Paste Handling: Allows pasting a 6-digit OTP code into the input fields.


- Validation: Ensures only numeric input is accepted.


- Auto-Submit: Submits the OTP once all fields are filled.
